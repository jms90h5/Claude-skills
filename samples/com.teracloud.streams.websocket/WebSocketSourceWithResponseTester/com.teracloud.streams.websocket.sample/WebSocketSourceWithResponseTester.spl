This example demonstrates the use of the WebSocketSource operator available
in the  toolkit. It does that by doing the ingestion of text or 
binary data from one or more remote WebSocket clients. It also shows how to
receive regular HTTP and HTTPS GET/PUT/POST messages from remote HTTP based
client applications. In addition, it shows how to receive a data item from the
remote WebSocket and/or HTTP clients, then do some analytics on that data and
return a result/response message back to that client.

[WebSocketSource operator from the  toolkit supports 
message reception via both WebSocket and HTTP on plain as well as secure endpoints.
Users will get a two-in-one benefit from this operator.]

Even though it is labeled as a source operator, WebSocketSource can be 
configured to perform like an analytic operator to receive data from the clients 
(WS or HTTP or both), process that data and send result/response back to a given client.
This application does exacly that. Please refer to the operator
invocation below where you will see in input port through which response data
can be fed into the operator. If the received data item came from a remote
HTTP client, then it gives a way to obtain all the HTTP request headers that a
given application may need for its business logic. If the response is being sent to 
a remote HTTP client, it also allows you to set your own appplication-specific 
custom HTTP rsponse headers. Those features are also demonstrated below. 
This application also shows the use of another optional input port that can be 
used to dynamically update the client whitelist.

[
In this example, we also show how to do mutual authentication
i.e. client and server authentication. In the Java based HttpPost
client operator, we show the use of the Java client side
trust store and key store. In the C++ based WebSocketSendReceive
client operator, we show the use of the trusted server's public certificate and
the client's private key and its public certificate. In a C++ WebSocketSource operator,
we show how it uses the client's public certificate to do the peer verification.
]
 
You can build this example from command line via the make command by using the
Makefile available in the top-level directory of this example. Inside that
Makefile, it will be necessary to export the STREAMS_WEBSOCKET_TOOLKIT 
environment variable by pointing it to the full path of your 
/com.teracloud.streams.websocket directory.

In order to test this application, you must first run this application below to
accept connections from the one or more copies of the companion application
(WebSocketHttpClientApp) available in this example directory and then receive 
data, process it and send result/response back to that remote client (full round-tripping).
After that, compile and run one or more copies of the companion application named 
"WebSocketHttpClientApp" available inside this example directory. When that application 
is run, it will keep attempting to open a WebSocket connection to the (server based) 
WebSocketSource operator shown in the application code below to start sending data.

NOTE: There is a run-ws-source-test.sh script available in the etc sub-directory of this
example project. That convenience script can be modified to suit your needs and run
this application along with 24 other test client applications running on three different
Streams instances. That will test the WebSocketSource operator in a scalabble way.
