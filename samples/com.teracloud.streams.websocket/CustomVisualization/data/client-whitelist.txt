# ===========================================================
# You can specify here any valid client whitelist value as
# shown below. The value you give here will override the
# existing value used by the WebSocketSource operator.
# Since it is a hot file, a FileSource operator present in
# the TaxiMetrics application continuously 
# monitors this file to read as soon as a new value is entered and
# saved in this file. It then feeds that value into an 
# optional input port of the WebSocketSource operator.
#
# A client whitelist tells the WebSocketSource operator to 
# accept connections only from specific IP addresses belonging to 
# the remote WebSocket clients. An empty list [] can be specified to 
# indicate all client connections to be accepted without any restrictions.
# If there is a need to accept connections only from certain clients, 
# then a list as shown below can be used by including wild cards as needed.
#
# ["172.34.18.212", "10.5.23.17", "172.*.42.*", "10.29.42.*"]
#
# You can dynamically add one whitelist at a time. Simply append a 
# new client whitelist line at the end of this file, press enter and 
# then save the file in order for your new value to be read immediately 
# by the already running TaxiMetrics application.
#
# Before starting the TaxiMetrics application, 
# you should check if this file is empty or has the correct values as expected.
# When adding a new client whitelist, it should strictly be in the
# SPL list<rstring> format as shown above. Any incorrect format will 
# cause the application to give runtime errors.
