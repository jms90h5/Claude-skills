    <description>
This operator issues a `ping` command against the host specified in each input tuple. It submits the results
of the `ping` command as an output tuple.  Each input tuple will result in a `ping` command consisting of three pings to the
designated host. The operator takes no parameters.

This `Pinger` operator is a non-generic primitive operator; it levies requirements on the schemas of its input and output streams.
The requirements are outlined in the description of the operator's input and output ports.

This port consumes a stream whose schema must include exactly one attribute whose name is `host`. 
The type of this `host` attribute must be `rstring`. Additional attributes of any type may also 
appear in the input stream.
  
The host name specified in the `host` attribute will be pinged three times on receipt of each 
input tuple.

This port produces a stream whose schema must include exactly one attribute whose name is `ping`. The type of the `ping` 
attribute must be `rstring`. Any number of attributes from the input stream may also be specified as part of the output stream's
schema; their values are copied to the correspondingly-named output stream attributes.

The `ping` attribute on each output tuple will be assigned the results of the three pings executed by this operator.
