Overview: OperatorAndLibrary illustrates how to create primitive operators with
library dependencies.

The SampleOp primitive operator relies on an external library called MySampleLib
to print out a 'hello world' message.

1. To build the sample application:
   make

2. To run the sample application:
   ./output/bin/standalone

Notes:
  - The 'impl' directory contains the code for the external C++ library.
