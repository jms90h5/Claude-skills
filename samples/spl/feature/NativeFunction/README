Overview: NativeFunction demonstrates the use of C++ functions from SPL.

1. To build the sample application:
   make

2. To run the sample application:
   ./output/bin/standalone

Notes: 
  - One of the functions (getMcCarthy91_recursive_generic) is implemented as a
    C++ template function and is registered with the system using SPL generics.
    It works with multiple types.
  - The 'impl' directory contains the code and the library for the C++
    implementations of the native functions.
