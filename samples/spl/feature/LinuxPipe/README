Overview: LinuxPipe illustrates how to run Linux pipe commands in an SPL
application. As part of this, it also includes a primitive operator that
implements the basic functionality of running a Linux pipe command and
retreiving the results (standard output and error in two different streams).

1. To build the sample application:
   make

2. To run the sample application:
   ./output/bin/standalone

Notes: 
  - The input file is 'data/in.txt'.
  - The sample performs 2 sets of transformations on the input.
  - The result of the 1st set of transformations is stored in 'data/outA.txt'.
  - The result of the 2nd set of transformations is stored in 'data/outB.txt'.
  - Any errors from the 2nd set of transformations is stored in 'data/errB.txt'.
