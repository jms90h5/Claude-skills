Overview: Localization will demonstrate the use of a resource bundle
to hold translatable messages that can be loaded either at compile time
or at runtime, and formatted appropriatly for the execution locale.

1. To build the sample application:
   make

2. To run the sample application:
   ./output/bin/standalone

3. To run the sample application under a different locale, try
   LANG=tr_TR.UTF-8
   ./output/bin/standalone

Notes: 
  - The resulting output is written to the file 'data/Results.txt'.
