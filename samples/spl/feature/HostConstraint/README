Overview: HostConstraint illustrates how to use host placement constraints. 

The constraints specified in the sample app leave it to the runtime to decide
whether 'Man1' and 'Woman1' operators are to be placed on the same host as the
'Sheep<n>' operators or the 'Wolf<n>' operators.

   make

Note: This sample is designed to be run on a Streams instance.
