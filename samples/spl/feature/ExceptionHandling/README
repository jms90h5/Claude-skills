Overview:

ExceptionHandling shows an example of the @catch annotation. Use @catch when the PE
must not crash when an operator throws an exception when processing a tuple.

1. To build the same application:
   make

2. To run the sample application:
   ./output/bin/standalone

3. The resulting output should have all tuples, except the invalid tuple that causes
an exception to be thrown. The console should display information regarding the tuple
causing an exception to be thrown.
