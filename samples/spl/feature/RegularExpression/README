Overview: RegularExpression will reformat date/time text using regular expressions. 

1. To build the sample application:
   make

2. To run the sample application:
   ./output/bin/standalone

Notes: 
  - The input file is 'data/SourceData.txt'.   
  - The transformation maps numeric months to their alphabetic version.
  - The sample shows the same algorithm implemented with ustring (unicode) 
    and rstring (raw).
  - The resulting outputs (from each implementation) are written to
    'data/SinkDataU.txt' and 'data/SinkDataR.txt'. The two output files should
    be identical.
