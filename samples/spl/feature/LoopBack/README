Overview: LoopBack will compute the factorals of numbers from 1 to 9, by using
an operator to perform each step of the factorial for a given number. Sucessive
steps are performed by cycling the partial result through the operator using a
feedback loop.

1. To build the sample application:
   make

2. To run the sample application:
   ./output/bin/standalone

Notes: 
  - The resulting output is written to the file 'data/Results.txt'.
