Overview: TypedArguments will echo values from command line parameters that are
specified as strings containing SPL literals.

1. To build the sample application:
   make

2. To run the sample application:
   ./test.sh

Notes: 
  - The command line argument 'strlist' expects a string list literal and
    'strmap' expects a map literal that maps from a string to another. 
  - The 'test.sh' script calls the standalone SPL application with sample
    command line parameters.
