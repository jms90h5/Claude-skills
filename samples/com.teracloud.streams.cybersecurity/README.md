Streams cybersecurity toolkit samples

* These sample applications are compatible with **Streams 7.2** and later.
* Requires version **[5.0.0,6.0.0)** of the toolkits `com.teracloud.streams.cybersecurity` and `com.teracloud.streams.network`

## Quick Start

 1. Each application comes with a build.xml that will compile the application using local Streams
   - For the BWListTaggerSamples, DomainProfilingSamples, DNSTunnelingSamples and HostProfilingSamples application, run `ant` or `ant -Dcybersecurity.toolkit=<path_to_cybersecurity_toolkit>`
 2. Submit the job! (the *.sab file can be found in the `output` directory)
