## HostProfilingSample

This sample demonstrates how you can use the HostProfiling operator from the `com.teracloud.streams.cybersecurity` toolkit.

## Use with local Streams installation

Build the application:

`ant`

The application is build using the cybersecurity and network toolkit from the local Streams installation ("$STREAMS_INSTALL/toolkits").

Launch:

`./output/HostProfilingBasic_Output/bin/standalone`

or 

`ant standalone`

Alternative you can submit the `./output/HostProfilingBasic_Output/com.teracloud.streams.cybersecurity.sample.HostProfilingBasic.sab` file to your Streams instance.
In the Streams Console, go to the Log Viewer and Click on the PE's Console Log to view the output.

Clean:

`ant clean`
