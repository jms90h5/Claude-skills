This application demonstrates how to use the DPS toolkit Java API from a Java operator.

To compile this application from the command line, run the Makefile by typing "make"
Launch by submitting the job to the domain:
streamtool submitjob -d [domain] output/JavaDPSDemo/Distributed/application.JavaDPSDemo.sab

NOTE:
If the toolkit is not located in the standard Streams toolkit directory (for example,
because you loaded it from Github), you have to set the environment variable STREAMSX_DPS_TOOLKIT
to point to the directory where the info.xml file of the toolkit is located.
For example enter the command :
export STREAMSX_DPS_TOOLKIT=/myhome/mytoolkits/com.teracloud.streams.dps
before running the make command.
If this variable is not set the DPS toolkit from the standard Streams toolkit location will be used.
