configure the access control lists for domain and instance objects by using the <span class="keyword">Streams
Console</span>, REST management API, or JMX management API.</p>

<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Configure the method by which the application user is authenticated
for access to Streams.</span> <ul class="ul choices">
<li class="li choice">The Streams REST management API supports HTTP basic
authentication. To use HTTP basic authentication, you must supply a user name and password in the
HTTP Authorization request header. The user ID and password must be UTF-8 bytes that are encoded by
using the MIME variant of Base64. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Some browsers only support 8859-1 characters in HTTP
headers. If you use a browser to access the Streams REST management API and the user or password contain characters outside the 8859-1 character set, the
browser that you use must support UTF-8 characters in HTTP headers.</div>
<p class="p"> If you are using the
REST management API from a web browser, the browser prompts you for this information. The message includes a realm name, which is the URL-encoded name of IBM Streams. If you want to decode this realm name, use a URL decoder.</p>
<p class="p"> For a code sample that
uses HTTP basic authentication, see the example in <a class="xref" href="ProcessingRest.html" title="To access information from IBM Streams by using the REST management API, your application must send a valid HTTP request. The application must then handle the HTTP response.">Processing REST management API requests</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Validate the Streams certificate
to determine whether the Streams server
is trusted.</span> <p class="p">By default, Streams identifies
itself to clients by using a self-signed certificate. You must store
this certificate in a truststore on the client system. You can use
the Streams Console, REST management API or JMX management API to export the keystore from the server and import into a client truststore to store
the certificate. Your application must validate the certificate that
it receives when it establishes the HTTPS connection to the Streams server.
You can validate the certificate that you receive from the server
by comparing it to the certificate in the truststore. In addition,
since the Streams certificate
is not specific to a single server, you must also provide a host name
verifier to trust the certificate. For a code sample that provides
a host name verifier, see the example in <a class="xref" href="ProcessingRest.html" title="To access information from Streams by using the REST management API, your application must send a valid HTTP request. The application must then handle the HTTP response.">Processing REST management API requests</a>.</p>
