        <p>Streams manages security by principals (users, groups and
        roles). Security objects protect Streams objects and
        manages access to these objects. A user is granted
        permission if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the user has specific permission to the object,</li>
          <li>or if any of the groups the user belongs to has specific

            <h3 class="ibm-h3 ibm-regular">Users</h3>
            <p>Users are defined by the back end authentication provider
              Streams is configured to use, for example LDAP.&nbsp;
              Streams does not manage users in this repository.&nbsp; In
              order to manage the users such as adding, updating and
              removing users, you must use the tools provided by the
              provider.&nbsp; Streams is only aware of the users that
              have specific Streams permissions.&nbsp; Listing users via the
              REST management API will only return the list of users Streams is
              aware of, not the complete list of users in the back end
              store.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Users can be granted specific object permissions.&nbsp;
              For example, "read" access to security object "job_0" for
              user A grants user A access to information about the job with identifier 
              0.&nbsp; A user can be assigned one or more roles.&nbsp;
              Managing user access to Streams by roles is the
              recommended approach.&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
            <h3 class="ibm-h3 ibm-regular">Groups</h3>
            <p>Groups, like users, are defined by the back end authentication
              provider Streams is configured to use.&nbsp; As with users, groups must be managed by
              using the tools supplied by the provider.&nbsp; Streams is
              only aware of groups that have explicit Streams
              permissions.&nbsp; Listing groups via the REST management API will only
              return the list of groups Streams is aware of, not the
              complete list of groups in the back end store.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Groups can be granted specific object permissions.&nbsp;
              For example, "read" access to security object "job_0" for
              group A grants every user that belong to group A access to
              information about the job with identifier 0.&nbsp; A group can be assigned
              one or more roles.&nbsp; All users that belong to the
              group would have the super set of all permissions for roles the
              group has been assigned.<br>
            </p>
            <h3 class="ibm-h3 ibm-regular">Roles</h3>
            <p>Roles are defined by Streams and can be used to group
              permissions.&nbsp; Unlike users and groups, roles are
              defined by Streams and can be managed by using the tools
              provided by Streams.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Roles can be granted specific object permissions.&nbsp;
              For example, "read" access to security object "job_0" for
              role JOBUSER would grant every user that has been assigned
              the role of JOBUSER, and any user that belongs to any group
              that has been assigned the role of JOBUSER access to
              information about the job with identifier 0.&nbsp; Roles is the recommended
              way of managing access to Streams.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="ibm-h2 ibm-bold"><a name="securityobjects"></a>Security
              Objects</h2>
            <p>Streams uses security objects to manage access to Streams
              objects. For exmple, you can manage access to the domain, instances, hosts and jobs.<br>
            </p>
            <h3 class="ibm-h3 ibm-regular"><a name="permissions"></a>Permissions</h3>
            <p>The permission settings are the settings Streams checks
              for access.&nbsp; For example, if security object job_0
              has delete permission set for user A, then user A has the
              ability to cancel the job with identifier 0.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            The following permissions are supported.
            </p>    
            <blockquote>
                <dl>
                  <dt>Search</dt>
                  <dd>Controls the ablilty to list children
                    objects. For example, "search" permission to a job
                    group for user A allows user A to list the jobs
                    submitted under that job group.<br>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Add</dt>
                  <dd>Controls the ability to add a child
                    object.&nbsp; For example, "add" permission to a job
                    group for user A allows user A to submit a job under
                    that job group.<br>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Delete</dt>
                  <dd>Controls the ability to delete the
                    object.&nbsp; For example, "delete" permission to
                    job_0 for user A allows user A to cancel the job with identifier 0.<br>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Read</dt>
                  <dd>Controls the ability to access information
                    about the object.&nbsp; For example, "read" permission
                    to job_0 for user A allows user A to access job
                    information and job data for the job with identifier 0.<br>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Write</dt>
                  <dd>Controls the ability to change the
                    information about the object.&nbsp; For example,
                    "write" permission to job_0 for user A allows user A
                    to manage the job, such as stop and start PEs for 
                    the job with identifier 0.<br>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Own</dt>
                  <dd>Grants the user special
                    permission to the object. For example, "own"
                    permission to job_0 for user A gives user A all
                    access to the job with identifier 0, regardless of what the other
                    permissions are for user A.</dd>
                </dl>

              Permissions</h3>
            <p>Default permissions are permissions that children objects
              inherit when they are created.&nbsp; Default permissions
              are not used for permission calculations.&nbsp; For
              example, if security object for job group JOBGROUP1 has
              default permissions of read, write and delete for user A,
              when the first job is submitted to JOBGROUP1 (job identifier 0),
              the security object job_0 would have permissions of read,
              write and delete for user A.<br>

            <h3 class="ibm-h3 ibm-regular"><a name="resolvedpermissions"></a>Resolved Permissions</h3>
            <p>Resolved permissions are what the user has for
              permissions after Streams has resolved the permissions
              using all the groups to which the user belongs, all the roles
              assigned to the user, and all the roles assigned to the
              groups to which the user belongs.<br>
